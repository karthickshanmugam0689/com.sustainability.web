// In an ideal world this file would not be necessary
// the 'composite' flag all of our tsconfig files are inheriting from the base config tell the language server,
// that all packages are part of something bigger.
// The language server will subsequently analyze all projects at the same time.
// It will be able to kniow if a class defined in one package is used in another package.
// You as developer will thus be able to find references all over the repo.
// BUT: Some packages use ncc which doesn't work with composite. So they disable the flag.
// This would mean we can't find references in these apps to symbols in any of our libs.
// Tghuis file here fixes the issue. It exists solely for this purpose.
